              "I know that leaving your furry family member with someone isn't easy, and the news can be full of horror stories, so I'd like to tell you a little more about me and why I love dog grooming.",
              "I'm a second generation groomer and I've been grooming professionally since 2002. Prior to that, I began bathing dogs for my mother in her shop when I was 10 years old. I loved getting to interact with so many different breeds! She not only taught me how to properly clean the dogs, but how to handle them with patience and care. These moments were some of my favorite childhood memories, and those times led me to apprentice with her and later work in multiple grooming shops throughout the years. I've met some amazing groomers and lifelong friends along the way.",
              "I've been so lucky to have worked with and learn different techniques from all kinds of experienced groomers. After almost two decades of grooming in other shops, I decided it was time to branch out and start my own business. I've developed Wagsworth's to create an environment that I believe will be beneficial to your dog and will allow me to do my best work for them.",
              "The best part of my day is seeing how happy my clients are when they see their dog, and how excited the dog gets when they're showing off their fresh new haircut. The happier the client is, the happier the dog is!",
              "Creating lasting bonds with the dogs I work with is my highest priority. I want their time with me to feel safe and be as stress-free as possible.",
              "Finding the right groomer for you is of utmost importance. Don't be afraid to ask questions and make sure you feel secure leaving your beloved pet with us. Dog grooming can be physically tough, dirty work, that can sometimes stress out a dog, which is why employing a professional, experienced groomer is crucial.",
              "I look forward to meeting you and your dog and forging a rapport of trust, compassion, and perfectly presented fur!",
              "I'd like to add a sentimental last note: I want to thank my mom for introducing me to the world of dogs and teaching me to groom. In our family a dog was never 'just a dog'. They were our family and just as loved as us kids (maybe more). So thank you, mom, for supplying me with the skills to do something I would not only love, but able to do for a living. I will always be grateful."

              "I'm a second generation groomer and I've been grooming professionally since 2002. Prior to that, I began bathing dogs for my mother in her shop when I was 10 years old. I loved getting to interact with so many different breeds! She not only taught me how to properly clean the dogs, but how to handle them with patience and care. These moments were some of my favorite childhood memories, and those times led me to apprentice with her and later work in multiple grooming shops throughout the years. I've met some amazing groomers and lifelong friends along the way.",
              "I've been so lucky to have worked with and learn different techniques from all kinds of experienced groomers. After almost two decades of grooming in other shops, I decided it was time to branch out and start my own business. I've developed Wagsworth's to create an environment that I believe will be beneficial to your dog and will allow me to do my best work for them.",
              "The best part of my day is seeing how happy my clients are when they see their dog, and how excited the dog gets when they're showing off their fresh new haircut. The happier the client is, the happier the dog is!",
              "Creating lasting bonds with the dogs I work with is my highest priority. I want their time with me to feel safe and be as stress-free as possible.",
              "Finding the right groomer for you is of utmost importance. Don't be afraid to ask questions and make sure you feel secure leaving your beloved pet with us. Dog grooming can be physically tough, dirty work, that can sometimes stress out a dog, which is why employing a professional, experienced groomer is crucial.",
              "I look forward to meeting you and your dog and forging a rapport of trust, compassion, and perfectly presented fur!",
              "I'd like to add a sentimental last note: I want to thank my mom for introducing me to the world of dogs and teaching me to groom. In our family a dog was never 'just a dog'. They were our family and just as loved as us kids (maybe more). So thank you, mom, for supplying me with the skills to do something I would not only love, but able to do for a living. I will always be grateful."

              "I know that leaving your furry family member with someone isn't easy, and the news can be full of horror stories, so I'd like to tell you a little more about me and why I love dog grooming.",
              "I'm a second generation groomer and I've been grooming professionally since 2002. Prior to that, I began bathing dogs for my mother in her shop when I was 10 years old. I loved getting to interact with so many different breeds! She not only taught me how to properly clean the dogs, but how to handle them with patience and care. These moments were some of my favorite childhood memories, and those times led me to apprentice with her and later work in multiple grooming shops throughout the years. I've met some amazing groomers and lifelong friends along the way.",
              "I've been so lucky to have worked with and learn different techniques from all kinds of experienced groomers. After almost two decades of grooming in other shops, I decided it was time to branch out and start my own business. I've developed Wagsworth's to create an environment that I believe will be beneficial to your dog and will allow me to do my best work for them.",
              "The best part of my day is seeing how happy my clients are when they see their dog, and how excited the dog gets when they're showing off their fresh new haircut. The happier the client is, the happier the dog is!",
              "Creating lasting bonds with the dogs I work with is my highest priority. I want their time with me to feel safe and be as stress-free as possible.",
              "Finding the right groomer for you is of utmost importance. Don't be afraid to ask questions and make sure you feel secure leaving your beloved pet with us. Dog grooming can be physically tough, dirty work, that can sometimes stress out a dog, which is why employing a professional, experienced groomer is crucial.",
              "I look forward to meeting you and your dog and forging a rapport of trust, compassion, and perfectly presented fur!",
              "I'd like to add a sentimental last note: I want to thank my mom for introducing me to the world of dogs and teaching me to groom. In our family a dog was never 'just a dog'. They were our family and just as loved as us kids (maybe more). So thank you, mom, for supplying me with the skills to do something I would not only love, but able to do for a living. I will always be grateful."
